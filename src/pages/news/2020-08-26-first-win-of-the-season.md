Great to see us play at such high intensity and compete from the very first whistle to the last. Despite being pegged back twice in the game, we showed all the attributes, fight, endeavour and more importantly a team spirit that is key to us going onto bigger and better things this season.

Just goes to show the level of performance we can achieve when we are all at it as a collective unit. Plenty of hard work ahead of us, but itâ€™s a small step in the right direction lads.
